# VM Environments

Primary development is on the mac; this direcdtory contains a set of directories each with a vagrant environment that allow for:
- development using Linux and Python for comparison with original Mignis
- runtime target for running a firewall using iptables/nftables 
- runtime target for a client with firewall as it's egress

Each Vagrant/VM will be based on the same base linux image.
